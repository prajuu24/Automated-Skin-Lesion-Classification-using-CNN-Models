# 🚀 Automated Skin Lesion Classification using CNN Models

## 📌 About the Project
This project aims to build an **Automated Skin Lesion Classification System** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to classify different types of **skin cancer lesions** from image data.  
The primary goal is to implement and compare the performance of various **Deep Learning Models** such as:  
- ✅ **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**  
- ✅ **DenseNet (Pre-trained Model)**  
- ✅ **Deep Learning Models**  

The model achieved an **accuracy of over 86%**, providing a significant step in the **early detection of skin cancer** and assisting **dermatologists** in clinical decision-making.  


## 🏥 Types of Skin Lesions Detected
The model is capable of classifying the following skin lesions:  
- ✅ **Melanoma (Cancerous)**  
- ✅ **Benign Nevus (Non-cancerous)**  
- ✅ **Seborrheic Keratosis (Non-cancerous)**  


## 💻 Tech Stack Used
The following technologies were used to build and train the model:  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries/Frameworks:**  
  - TensorFlow  
  - Keras  
  - OpenCV  
  - NumPy  
  - Pandas  
  - Matplotlib  
  - Seaborn  
  - Scikit-learn  
- **Platform:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  


## 📊 Dataset Used
The dataset contains thousands of skin lesion images, labeled as:  
- ✅ **Melanoma (Cancerous)**  
- ✅ **Benign Nevus (Non-cancerous)**  
- ✅ **Seborrheic Keratosis (Non-cancerous)**  


## 📈 Model Performance
The following models were implemented and their performance was compared:  

| Model       | Accuracy (%)  | Precision   | Recall     | F1-Score   |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
